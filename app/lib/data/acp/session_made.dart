/// `curl` probed, the pages a `curl -o` downloaded, the files a `grep` named.
/// So a row needs the agent to have MADE or ANNOUNCED the thing:
/// - a page: a completed edit, a file a command writes (`>`, `tee`, `-o`,
///   `cp`/`mv` target, `open`), a "Saved to ..." line a tool printed, or a path
///   in the agent's own words;
/// - a picture or a document: the same, except that a document must be a NEW
///   file (not an edit of a README) and that naming one in words needs a word of
///   making right before it ("saved screenshots/a.png"), because the chat names
///   existing files all day;
/// - a server: a link in the agent's own words, or a banner line a launched
///   command printed (`Local: http://localhost:5173/`).
